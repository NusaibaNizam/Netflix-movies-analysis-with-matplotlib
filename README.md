# Netflix 1990s Movie Analysis

**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

This project focuses on movies released in the **1990s**. Using Netflix data, we will perform exploratory data analysis to better understand this nostalgic decade of movies.

You have been supplied with the dataset `netflix_data.csv` for this analysis. Feel free to experiment further after submission!
